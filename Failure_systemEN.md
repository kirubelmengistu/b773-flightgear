Every minute, this script generates a random number between 0 and 1. Then, there are some 'base' chances for each failure, let's say theres 0.001 base chance for an engine fire. Now the base value is being multiplied by the coefficient (adjustable from 1 to 1000). If the generated random number is lower than the multiplication result, something bad happens, hehe. I don't know the standard deviation value for the rand(); function in Nasal, so i can't really tell, what's the probability for base value of 0.001.
